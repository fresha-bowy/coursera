     <p >  Okay, you have finished about half the course. Congratulations. If you didn't know HTML and CSS before, or didn't know it well, take a moment and look back. You are now way more skilled than a lot of people who simply mess around with HTML and CSS without knowing the foundational concepts. Take a moment and reflect. It's pretty empowering isn't it? In the next module, we'll start coding a real website for a real client. Keep going to module three. You do not want to miss this. </p>
